# BLOCKBUSTER 2.0
3rd week project of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack - MAD OCT

The goal is to create a database for a video rental store chain.
The first step will be to clean the existing tables, verify their coherence and create new tables with python.
Then, create the EER diagram* with the tables, feed the tables with the CSV documents exported from python and create the relationships between the tables.
At the end, some queries are used to test the database.

/python 

    src.py -- contains the functions for data cleansing
    main.ipynb -- contains the main code for data cleansing, table creations and exportation as CSV

/SQL

    create.sql -- the SQL code for creation of the database, include the feeding of the tables and their relatioships.
    queries.sql -- includes 10 different queries


* The EER Diagram is available here:
