# BLOCKBUSTER 2.0
3rd week project of the Data analytics bootcamp at Ironhack - MAD OCT

The goal is to create a database for a video rental store chain.
The first step will be to clean the existing tables, verify their coherence and create new tables with python.
Then, create the EER diagram with the relations between the tables and insert the content from notebook output CSV documents.
At the end, when the SQL database is created, create queries.

/python 
src.py -- contains the functions for data cleansing
main.ipynb -- contains the main code for data cleansing, table creations and exportation as CSV

/SQL
create.sql -- the SQL code for creation of the database, include the feeding of the tables and their relatioships.
queries.sql -- includes 10 different queries
